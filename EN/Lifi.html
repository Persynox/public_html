<p><b>Did you know that your bedside lamp could become your new internet relay? Li-Fi, a new wireless communication technology, a brilliant idea! </b></p>

<H2>What is Li-Fi?</H2>

<p>Li-Fi or <b>Light Fidelity</b> is quite similar to its cousin Wi-Fi. Just like it, it is a wireless communication technology. However, it has the particularity of using visible light. Indeed, while Wi-Fi uses <b>radio waves</b>, invisible to us, Li-Fi uses <b>waves that can be seen</b>: it is the <b>visible spectrum</b>.</p>

  <H2>How does it work (in short)?</H2>

<p>You may not have heard of this technology before, and that's okay. Indeed, until now, the development of Li-Fi was quite limited. First, the system needed to be improved (and it is now done), then the Li-Fi technology is dependent on another technology: <b>LED lighting</b>.</p>

<p>Indeed, Li-Fi does not work with any lighting, but only with <b>LEDs</b>. Why LEDs? Because they have the particularity of being able to turn off and on thousands of times per second. In order to transmit information (0's and 1's) the LED performs a kind of luminous <b>morse code</b>: no light = 0, light = 1.</p>

<p>But then, a light bulb that keeps going off and on must give you a headache? No worries! This flashing is <b>so fast that it is invisible to the human eye</b>!</p>

    <H2>Why is it great (or not)?</H2>

<p>In theory, Li-Fi would have the advantage of being <b>10 to 100 times faster than Wi-Fi</b>! No more long minutes (or even hours for the poorest) to download a movie! But most importantly, Li-Fi <b>does not go through walls</b>, so it is easier to <b>protect your network</b>.</p>

<p>However, Li-Fi also has its limits. This is because reception is only optimal in the area <b>precisely under the lighting</b>. Finally, it's not very practical to hang out all <b>night</b> on Facebook without being seen by your parents!</p>

<p>This technology with great potential is still in its infancy, it could be particularly useful in public places, but it remains to be seen what uses it could develop.</p>

<p>And you, do you think it could replace Wi-Fi? Or just complete it?</p>
