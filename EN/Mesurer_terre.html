<H1>Measuring the circumference of the Earth with a stick and a camel</H1>

<body>
<p><b>One of the most interesting scientific anecdotes: measuring the circumference of the Earth with a stick, a camel, and some basic geometry...</b></p>

<H2>Who is it? When?</H2>

<p>At the origin of this brilliant process, a genius from another time: <b>Eratosthenes</b>. A great scholar of the 3rd century B.C., he was appointed head of the famous <b>library of Alexandria</b>.</p>

<H2>How do you do it?</H2>

<p>Eratosthenes observed that at noon, on the day of the <b>summer solstice</b> (when the sun is at its highest in the sky), a well located in <b>Syene</b> did <b>not cast any shadow</b>, and that the sun illuminated its bottom well. He deduced that the sun's rays were arriving right at the vertical of the earth at this point. The sun's rays therefore point to the <b>center of the earth</b>.</p>

<p>He then asked a friend in <b>Alexandria</b> (about 1000 km north of Syene) to plant a <b>stick</b> in the ground, straight (so that it also points to the center of the Earth), and to measure the <b>shadow</b> it cast. Unlike the well in Syene, here the stick casts a shadow. By measuring the shadow cast by the stick, he could measure the angle formed between the sun's rays and the stick. This angle is identical to the angle formed α center of the Earth between Alexandria and (<b>angle "α"</b> on the diagram). Therefore, by transferring this angle as many times as necessary to obtain <b>360°</b>, and by multiplying as many times the distance Syene-Alexandria, we obtain the <b>circumference of the Earth</b>!</p>

  <H2>And the camel in all this?</H2>

  <p>Wait a minute, I'm getting to that!</p>

  <p>To carry out his calculations, Erathostene missed only one measurement: the <b>distance Syene-Alexandria</b>. Today, this calculation is simple and extremely accurate thanks to geolocation, but at the time, Eratosthenes called upon a bematist. A <b>bematist</b> was a person who measured great distances by counting the <b>steps of his camel</b> (reputed to have a very regular step).</p>

  <H2>And the result?</H2>

<p>2200 years ago, at a time when we were not even sure that the <b>Earth was round</b>, Eratosthenes measured its circumference and was finally wrong by only <b>700 km</b> (out of 40,000 km, which is quite reasonable).</p>
